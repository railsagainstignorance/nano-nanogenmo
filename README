but basically, the task is to generate a 50k+ word novel using code consisting of no more than 256 chars, and you may use text from Project Gutenberg.

First stab

- to use Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342.
- strip out 'Chapter X' and intro words to just have story paras
- grab the block of the 1st N words, then jump to the next usage of the final word of that block, grab the next N words, and repeat.
- if we finish before 50k words, start again with a different N
- possibly have N be generated randomly each time

e.g.
N=6

but she smiled [...smiled] . “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued [...continued] ...

Version 1: kicked off by the word 'acknowledged'.
