# NaNo-NaNoGenMo

see https://nickm.com/post/2019/11/nano-nanogenmo-or-nnngm/ for context

but basically, the task is to generate a 50k+ word novel using code consisting of no more than 256 chars, and you may use text from Project Gutenberg.


## First stab: SpliceSkip algorithm (2019/11/24)

The output is in spliceSkip_PrideAndPejudice.txt. 

This example of a generated novel has been [submitted to the NaNoGenMo initiative](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2019/issues/114).

To generate this output, run the file, invokeSpliceSkip.sh. This invokes the minified perl script on the full, plain text of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen from Project Gutenburg (which is in a file named 't'). Should work with other texts from the same collection.

The full code is

`perl -e'sub f{$N=1+int(rand(5));if(shift=~/^(\W*(?:\w+\W*){${N}})(\w+)(\W+)(.*)/){$b=$1;if($4=~/.*?(\W+${2})(.*)/i){return$b.$1.f($2);}return$1.$2.$3;}}$_=join("",<>);s/\R/ /g;s/.*Chapter 1 (.+)/\1/;while($c++<2500){$T=f($_)=~s/\s+/ /gr;print"$T.\n\n";}' t`

and uses 256 characters.

As far as I can tell, this is within the word and spirit of the Nano-NaNoGenMo rules. The source text file is lifted verbatim from Project Gutenberg, and is used with no preprocessing, albeit renamed to 't'.

### Notes

- to use Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342.
- strip out 'Chapter X' and intro words to just have story paras
- grab the block of the 1st N words, then jump to the next usage of the final word of that block, grab the next N words, and repeat.
- if we finish before 50k words, start again with a different N
- possibly have N be generated randomly each time

e.g.
N=6
It is a truth universally acknowledged, [... acknowledged] to be pretty,
but she smiled [...smiled] . “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
continued [...continued] ...
